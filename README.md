# Bumper Bumpers

This is a simple project for exploring SpriteKit and GameplayKit. It's 80% planned, 20% just seeing how to get things done.

It is more or less a rewrite and expansion of a previous project by the same name.

The game is basically about trying to force the opposing player out of the arena circle. It doesn't have much actual gameplay â€“ this project was more focused on how to put things together with SpriteKit and GameplayKit. As a game, it's not great, but as an exercise, it's proven pretty cool.

This project is up to date with XCode and Swift tech as of July 2019 and I believe should build and run with XCode straight away as no special configurations were made.
